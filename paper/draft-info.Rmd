## Done

* Refocused the introduction
* Moved details of taxonomic data cleaning process to supplementary materials
* Moved details of occurrence data cleaning process to supplementary materials
* Reorganised the results
* Rewrote most of the discussion
* Changed some details about how species are cleaned
* Removed species generality and the breadth of the environmental niche from the model

## To-do

* There are some warnings for when matching environmental variables to occurrences. I need to double check this is happeing correctly. 
* Refine the supplementary results. 
* Fix references
