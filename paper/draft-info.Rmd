## Requests to coauthors

* Should I include more data?

## Done

* Downloaded network data from the Web of Life and cleaned it. I didn't anticipated data needed SO MUCH work! I estimated three days to do this but took roughly 3 weeks to do it propperly and there is still some work to do. Quite a mess...

## To-do

* Manually fix the remaining species names that are incorrect and were not picked up by the automatic procedure
* Fix references. There are lots of mistakes re. author, years and publication venue.
