What determines whether or not a species is a generalist or a specialist? 
Evidence that the environment can influence species interactions is rapidly accumulating. 
However, a systematic link between environment and the number of partners a species interacts with has been elusive so far; presumably, because environmental gradients appear to have contrasting effects on species depending on the specific environmental variable. 
Here, we test whether the stresses imposed by the environment, instead of environmental gradients directly, influence species specialisation using a global dataset of plant-pollinator interactions. 
We found that environmental stress can significantly affect specialisation, even when accounting for changes in community composition, likely by interacting with species' traits and evolutionary history. 
Species that have a large number of interactions tended to focus on fewer, presumably higher-quality, interactions under stressful environmental conditions. 
Contrastingly, the specialists present in multiple locations tended to broaden their niche, presumably engaging in opportunistic interactions to cope with increased environmental stress. 
Indeed, many apparent specialists effectively behaved as facultative generalists. 
Overall, many of the species we analysed are not inherently generalist or specialist. 
Instead, the species' level of specialisation should be considered on a relative scale depending on the environmental conditions at a given location.
