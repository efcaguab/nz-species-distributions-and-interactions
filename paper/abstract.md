Ecological specialisation is central to species coexistence and the maintenance of biodiversity. 
But, what determines whether a species is a generalist or a specialist?
Evidence that the environment can influence species interactions is rapidly accumulating. 
However, a systematic link between the environment and ecological specialisation has been elusive so far; presumably because different environmental variables produce contrasting effects on species. 
Here, we test whether the stresses imposed by the environment influence species specialisation, using a global dataset of plant-pollinator interactions. 
We found that environmental stress can significantly affect specialisation, even when accounting for changes in community composition. 
Species that otherwise interact with many partners tended to focus on fewer, presumably higher-quality, interactions under stressful environmental conditions. 
In contrast, specialists that were present in multiple locations tended to broaden their niche, presumably engaging in opportunistic interactions, to cope with increased environmental stress.
