What determines whether or not a species is a generalist or a specialist? 
Evidence that the environment can influence species interactions is rapidly accumulating.
However, a systematic link between environment and the number of partners a species interacts with---the species degree---has been elusive so far; presumably, because environmental gradients appear to have contrasting effects on species depending on the environmental variable.
Here, we explore whether there is a relationship between the stresses imposed by the environment, instead of environmental gradients directly, and degree using a global dataset of plant-pollinator interactions.
We found that the environment can play a significant effect on species degree, even when accounting for community composition, likely by an interaction interact with species' traits and evolutionary history.
Specifically, species are more likely to attain intermediate levels of partners when environmental stress increases.
Species that have a large number of interactions are more likely to focus on a smaller number of, presumably higher-quality, interactions. 
Contrastingly, the specialists that can cope with increased stress are more likely to broaden their niche, presumably engaging in opportunistic interactions.
Many of the species we analysed are not inherently generalist or specialist, many as some specialists can effectively behave as facultative generalists.
Species' degree of generalisation should be measured on a relative scale depending on where they are found and the environmental conditions at that location.
