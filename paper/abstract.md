Evidence that the environment influences the interaction between species is rapidly accumulating. 
However, how it happens is currently unclear as environmental gradients appear to have contrasting or non-linear effects on the species' trophic niche breadth depending on the environmental variable. 
Here, we explore the relationship between the stresses imposed by the environment, instead of environmental gradients directly, and niche breadth using a global dataset of plant-pollinator interactions.
We found that environmental stress plays a significant role in determining the number of partners a species interacts with, but this role is highly variable across species. 
In particular, when faced with environmental stress, species that have a large number of interactions are more likely to focus on a smaller number of, presumably higher-quality, interactions. 
Contrastingly, the specialists that can cope with increased stress are more likely to broaden their niche and engage in opportunistic interactions, effectively behaving as facultative generalists.
