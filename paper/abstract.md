<!--Ecological specialisation is central to species coexistence and the maintenance of biodiversity.-->
Evidence that the environment can influence species interactions is rapidly accumulating, but can the environmental determine whether a species is a generalist or a specialist? 
Perhaps because different environmental variables produce contrasting effects on different species, a systematic link between the environment and specialisation has been elusive to date. 
Here, we use a global dataset of plant-pollinator interactions to test whether the stresses imposed by the environment influence species specialisation. 
We found that environmental stress can significantly affect specialisation, even when accounting for changes in community composition. 
Under stressful environmental conditions, species that otherwise interact with many partners tended to focus on fewer, presumably higher-quality, interactions. 
In contrast, specialists that were present in multiple locations tended to broaden their niche to cope with increased environmental stress, presumably by engaging in more opportunistic interactions.
