Not something to correct now, but as I was reading the summary of results for this chapter above, I thought about something that we might want to consider for that chapter. If we imagine that a species has a mean degree, and when we sample it, we find some distribution around that mean. We would sample extremely low or high values at low probability, and values closer to the mean with higher probability (assuming a normal or at least centrally-tending distribution). That means that species that are sampled outside of the stress area with extremely low or high degree are unlikely to be sampled again with the same extreme values. Instead, they are more likely to be sampled near the mean. Could that have occurred in our results?
